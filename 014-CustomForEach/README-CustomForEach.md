A function customForEach that behaves similarly to Array.prototype.forEach

two parameters:

    An array on which to iterate.
    A callback function that will be applied to each element of the array.

Iterate inside the function over each element of the array and call the callback function with three arguments:

    The current element.
    The index of the current element.
    The array itself.
