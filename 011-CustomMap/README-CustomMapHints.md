Hints to implement a custom version of the map function, named customMap, which mimics the behavior of Array.prototype.map.

The map method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function for each element in the calling array.

See:

To implement a customMap:

    Two parameters: an array and a callback function.
    Iterates over each element of the array.
    Applies the callback function to each element.
    Stores the result in a new array.
    Returns the new array.
