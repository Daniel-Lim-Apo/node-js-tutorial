To implement a customReduce function that behaves similarly to Array.prototype.reduce:

Be sure that the function accepts as parameters an array, a callback function, and an initial value for the accumulator.

Iterate through the array and apply the callback function to each element.

Update the accumulator with the value returned by the callback function.

Return the accumulated result after processing all elements.
